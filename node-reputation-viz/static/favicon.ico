The favicon.ico file is typically a binary file that represents the icon displayed in the browser tab. Since I cannot generate binary content directly, you should create or obtain a suitable favicon image and save it as favicon.ico in the specified directory.

If you need a placeholder or a specific favicon, you can create a simple one using an online favicon generator or design software. Once you have the image, save it as `/node-reputation-viz/node-reputation-viz/static/favicon.ico`.
